### API Endpoints

The app communicates with your AWTRIX device using these HTTP endpoints:
- `GET /api/screen` - Retrieves current display pixels (RGB888 JSON format)
- `GET /api/settings` - Fetches device settings
- `POST /api/settings` - Updates device configuration
- `GET /api/stats` - Gets device statistics (battery, current app, etc.)
- `POST /api/custom?name=companion` - Sends custom messages to display
- `POST /api/notify` - Sends notifications
- `POST /api/nextapp` - Switches to next app
- `POST /api/previousapp` - Switches to previous app
- `POST /ICON` - Uploads icon files (JPG format)

```

### Architecture

- **Model-First Architecture**: All device settings and display data use immutable data models
- **RGB888 JSON Format**: LED matrix data received as RGB888 JSON array from AWTRIX API
- **Service Layer**: Separation of HTTP API calls and business logic
- **Widget Composition**: Modular, reusable UI components
- **LaMetric Integration**: Automatic icon download from LaMetric with format conversion (PNG→JPG)

### Running Tests

```bash
flutter test                           # Run all tests
flutter test test/widget_test.dart     # Run specific test
```

### Code Quality

```bash
flutter analyze                        # Static analysis
flutter format lib/                    # Format code
```
