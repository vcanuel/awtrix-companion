# iOS builds are disabled because they require code signing with an Apple Developer certificate
# and provisioning profiles to be installable on devices or published to the App Store.
# Unsigned IPA files cannot be installed on iPhones/iPads.
# This workflow only runs tests and analysis to ensure iOS compatibility.
